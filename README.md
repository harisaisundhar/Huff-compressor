# Huff-compressor
A file compressor and extractor using huffman algorithm implemented using C language.

The program works by giving the user the choice to zip or extract.

In case of Zipping the file should be present in the same working directory and the zipped file will be created and stored in the same directory itself with prefix name of Zip.

To extract just put the zipped file name and the xtracted file will be retreived in the same physical directory, with a prefix name of ext.

Refer tutorials to understand huffman algorithms.
